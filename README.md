 found on Kaggle containing approximately more them 3500 properties that available at Airbnb website to better understand:

- Is the priece ralated to the property type?
- What's the most amenities availabe?
- Does some additions amenities make the property higher price?
- Is the price affected by seasons?

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.
